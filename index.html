        </ul>

        <ol>

        </ul>

        </ul>
        <p>To improve the sales and revenue among these customers we can implement the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Suggest complementary products that enhance the value of their initial purchase.</li>
            <li>Provide a compelling welcome offer or discount on their first purchase to encourage a second visit.</li>

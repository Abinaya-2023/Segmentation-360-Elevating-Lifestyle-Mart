            <li>These customers mostly visit warehouse clubs and pharmacy.</li>
            <li>So the revenue generated by the warehouses is higher than the other type of stores.</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Creating loyalty membership providing higher discounts, early access to the exclusive products and special member only events to these customers.</li>
            <li>Offer personalized discounts on their favorite products thus encouraging repeat purchases.</li>

        </ul>

        </ul>
        <p>To improve the sales and revenue among these customers we can implement the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Suggest complementary products that enhance the value of their initial purchase.</li>
            <li>Provide a compelling welcome offer or discount on their first purchase to encourage a second visit.</li>
